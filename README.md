#Survival Horror Clone
###OpenGL University programming project
Written in C++, uses OpenGL for 3D drawing and SDL 2.0 to setup the window.
Inspired by the classic Resident Evil games, I wrote a simple game engine that supported 3D characters imposed on 2D backgrounds.

##Install
```
qmake
make clean
make
./SDLOpenGL
```

##Suggested Improvements

Some planned features were not implemented on time.

* Correct the player collision behaviour so they stop when colliding with the scene boundaries.
* Add enemies to interact with.
* Add an inventory system.
